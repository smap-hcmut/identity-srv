## Overview

**SMAP Project Service** manages project-related operations for the SMAP platform. It provides CRUD operations for projects including brand tracking, competitor analysis, and keyword management.

### Key Features

- **Project Management**: Create, read, update, and delete projects
- **Brand Tracking**: Track brand names and keywords
- **Competitor Analysis**: Monitor competitor names and their associated keywords
- **Date Range Management**: Project timeline management with validation
- **Status Tracking**: Draft, Active, Completed, Archived, Cancelled
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own projects
- **Soft Delete**: Data retention for audit purposes

## Authentication

The Project service uses **HttpOnly cookie authentication** for secure, stateless authentication.

### Authentication Methods

**Primary: HttpOnly Cookies** (Recommended)
- Cookie name: `smap_auth_token`
- Set automatically by Identity service `/login` endpoint
- Sent automatically by browser with each request
- Secure attributes: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax

**Legacy: Bearer Token** (Deprecated)
- Supported for backward compatibility during migration
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
- Will be removed in future versions

### Getting Authenticated

```bash
# Login via Identity service to get cookie
curl -i -X POST https://smap-api.tantai.dev/identity/authentication/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "your_password",
    "remember": false
  }' \
  -c cookies.txt

# Cookie is now stored and will be sent automatically
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Make

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run migrations
make migrate-up

# Generate SQLBoiler models
make sqlboiler

# Run the service
make run-api
```

### API Examples

**Using Cookie Authentication (Recommended):**
```bash
# After logging in via Identity service, cookie is stored
# Use -b flag to send cookies with request
curl -X GET https://smap-api.tantai.dev/project/projects \
  -b cookies.txt
```

**Create Project with Cookie:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://smap-api.tantai.dev/project/projects \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Q1 2025 Campaign",
    "status": "draft",
    "from_date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "to_date": "2025-03-31T23:59:59Z",
    "brand_name": "MyBrand",
    "brand_keywords": ["mybrand", "my brand"],
    "competitor_names": ["Competitor A"],
    "competitor_keywords_map": {
      "Competitor A": ["competitor-a", "comp-a"]
    }
  }'
```

**Using Bearer Token (Legacy):**
```bash
# For backward compatibility during migration
curl -X POST https://smap-api.tantai.dev/project/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Q1 2025 Campaign",
    "status": "draft",
    "from_date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "to_date": "2025-03-31T23:59:59Z",
    "brand_name": "MyBrand",
    "brand_keywords": ["mybrand", "my brand"],
    "competitor_names": ["Competitor A"],
    "competitor_keywords_map": {
      "Competitor A": ["competitor-a", "comp-a"]
    }
  }'
```
